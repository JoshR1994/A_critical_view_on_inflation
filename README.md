# A critical view on inflation

This repository contains a Notebook with inflation and gold price data from Kaggle. In the first step, the goal was to correct the historical price of gold in Euro to the purchasing power of todays money, thus yielding increasing deviations between correted and nominal prices going further in the past and converging prices for today. In the next step, an additional 3% of "hidden" inflation was added to the "official" numbers from the IMF. Let me emphazise on this: Around the 90s in the USA as well as in Germany there had been modifications in the methology of determining the CPI (consumer price inflation). Several authors and economists, especially amongst followers of the austrian school of economics, suspect that these modifications lead to an underestimation of the true inflation. Politicians as well as central bankers have an obvious interest in understating the true inflation, because it allows them to continue reckless government spending and as a consequence inflation of the money supply. A website which tried to quantify the deviation between official and true inflations is www.shadowstats.com, suggesting that there is an undeestimation anywhere between 2% and 10% depending on the year. Adding 3% to every year seems therefore to be more on the conservative critical side.
